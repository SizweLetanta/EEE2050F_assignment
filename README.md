# STM32 Stopwatch Application

## Overview

This project is a C application designed to run on a UCT STM32F0 microcontroller board. The application utilises the interrupts generated by the TIM14 clock of the STM32 to provide accurate delays and uses an 16 x 2 LCD to display the time. The buttons connected to the GPIO pins are used to control the timer.

## Installation
1. Install the Visual Studio Code extension "stm32-for-vscode"
2. Ensure that the firmware for the debugger is up to date
3. Plug the STM32 board into the computer and use the extension to flash the code on the board.

## Usage
- To start the stopwatch, click button 0. 
- To lap the stopwatch, click button 1. This will display the lapped time while continuing to run in the background
- To pause the time, click button 2. This will display the time and stop the clock. The time can be resumed by clicking button 0 again.
- To reset the stopwatch, click button 3.

## Limitations
- Due to the low quality of the quartz crystal on installed on the device, the timing will not be entirely accurate and there will be a noticable difference in the length of a second.
- Because the program uses a loop to check for the click of a button, some button presses might not register. This can be prevented by holding the button until the effect is noticed on the display.
